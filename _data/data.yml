description:
  - paragraph: Potionomics is a singleplayer game where players assume the role of Sylvia, a penniless witch who must raise money to save her debt ridden potion shop from the clutches of greedy loan sharks. The game features a customizable 3D potion shop as well as a cast of colorfully animated characters inspired by the animation styles of Pixar and Studio Ghibli.
  - paragraph: Along the way, players will encounter mighty (and not-so-mighty) heroes, classic RPG creatures, and a genius economist trapped in an owl’s body. As every aspiring entrepreneur knows, customers will be fickle, competition will be fierce, and prices never stay stable. Add in some magic and you have a recipe for a magnificent adventure unlike any you’ve ever played before.
